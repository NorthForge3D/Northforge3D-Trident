# STLs – NorthForge3D Trident Proof-of-Concept  
This folder contains 3D-printable parts designed for the Trident-based dual-gantry development machine.

Unlike a complete printer release, parts will only be added here once they have been:

- Printed on real hardware  
- Evaluated for fit and basic functionality  
- Considered stable *enough* for early testing

---

## 📦 Current Status  
- Original Voron STLs were removed to avoid confusion.  
- New NorthForge3D parts will appear gradually as they pass testing.  
- This is intentionally a **slow, iterative** process — quality matters more than completeness.

---

## 📁 Planned Folder Structure  
As more parts accumulate, this folder will likely be organized as:

- `Frame/` – printed brackets and structural components  
- `Gantry/` – motion-related printed parts  
- `Toolheads/` – carriages, extruder mounts, hotend components  
- `Electronics/` – mounts, covers, cable guides  
- `Misc/` – jigs, test prints, experimental geometries  

Each category may gain its own notes or documentation later.

---

## ⚠️ Build Warning  
Even if STLs exist here:

- This project is not ready to be built by the public  
- Mechanical and thermal safety validations are ongoing  
- Expect redesigns and updated parts  

Print files here are primarily intended for development contributors, reviewers, and testers.

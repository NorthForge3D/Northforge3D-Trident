# Frame – NorthForge3D Trident POC

This directory contains CAD related to the structural frame, including:
- 2020 frame geometry
- Corner stiffeners meant to reduce motion at joints (the weakest point in any frame system)
- Modified skirts
- Bottom panel that integrates with the new electronics bay
- Z-motor locations (included for stiffener clearance)

The objective is to increase rigidity, simplify assembly, and prepare for a 
future enclosed structure with improved thermal stability.

These changes form the foundation for validating motion accuracy 
before scaling into the NorthForge3D Deuce. Additional frame stiffness will be gained in the panels CAD

# Panels – NorthForge3D Trident POC

This directory contains CAD for enclosure and paneling work:
- Rear and side aluminum stiffener panel (lower)
- Side and front clear panels (upper)
- Revised mounting geometry to match frame changes

The panel system contributes to:
- Structural reinforcement
- Still allows for clear view of the new gantry / motion system. 

These panel changes allow the Trident proof-of-concept to serve as a realistic 
test platform for future NorthForge3D enclosures.

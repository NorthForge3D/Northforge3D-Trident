## Trident Original CAD – Reference Only

This directory contains the pristine, unmodified CAD files of the original 
Voron Trident design.

These files are used strictly for:
- Measurement reference
- Comparison against NorthForge3D modifications
- Alignment checks
- Ensuring compatibility during early development phases

Do not modify these files.  
They serve as the fixed reference baseline for the entire project.

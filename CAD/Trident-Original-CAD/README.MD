# Trident-Base-Files

Reference geometry derived from the Voron Trident footprint.  
Used as a dimensional and conceptual baseline for:

- Dual-gantry testing  
- Belt path development  
- Motion-system refinement  
- Component placement  
- Frame interactions  

This folder does *not* contain a complete or buildable Trident kit.  
It exists solely to support NorthForge3D R&D.

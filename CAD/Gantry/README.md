# Gantry – NorthForge3D Trident POC

This directory contains CAD for all gantry-related components, including:
- Dual-gantry concept integration
- Motion system refinements
- XY rails and carriages
- Toolhead mounting geometry
- Idlers, belt paths, and tensioning systems

The gantry is the heart of the precision validation phase.  
Our goal is to confirm smooth motion, rigidity, and alignment in CAD prior to 
prototyping and physical testing.

The results of this subsystem will heavily influence the motion system that 
powers the NorthForge3D Deuce. The printer derived from this build will help us fine tune our Klipper stacks to move that motion system on this printer an the Deuce.

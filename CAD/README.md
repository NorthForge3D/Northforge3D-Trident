# NorthForge3D – CAD Directory

This directory contains all CAD work related to the NorthForge3D Trident-based
proof-of-concept printer. The goal of this phase is to validate key design 
modifications in CAD before physical construction begins.

The work here includes:
- A redesigned electronics bay
- Structural frame stiffeners
- Updated panel system
- Modified gantry and motion components
- A complete reassembled model for fitment and validation

The CAD in this directory represents the *working* design files.  
Reference files for the original Trident configuration are included for comparison.

# CAD – NorthForge3D Trident Proof-of-Concept  
This folder contains the evolving **canonical CAD** for the NorthForge3D Trident-based dual-gantry development platform.

The purpose of this CAD is to support rapid experimentation as we refine motion systems, electronics placement, and the overall engineering direction for the upcoming **NorthForge3D Deuce**.

---

## 🛠 CAD Tools  
- Primary: **Autodesk Fusion 360**  
- Future exports: **STEP** files will be added as designs stabilize.  
- CAD here may change frequently during early development.

---

## 📌 Engineering Status  
The CAD in this folder should be considered **experimental**:

- Dimensions, clearances, and mechanical interfaces are still in flux.  
- Components may undergo major redesigns as we validate dual-gantry layouts.  
- None of the CAD here should be treated as production-ready.

As the project matures, this folder will be organized into:

- `Frame/` – structural and extrusion components  
- `Gantry/` – motion system geometry  
- `Toolheads/` – carriages, hotend assemblies, extruder mounts  
- `Electronics/` – mounts, brackets, and internal layout components

## 📡 Follow the Build  
We are building this machine fully in the open.

These are optional, but they offer the full context behind the engineering decisions reflected in this CAD.

## ⚠️ Build Warning  
Nothing in this folder is intended for public builds at this time.  
Use the CAD only for learning, reviewing, or contributing — not for constructing a printer.

When the design stabilizes, we will publish a clearer structure and final export files.

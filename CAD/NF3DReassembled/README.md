# NF3D Reassembled – Full Printer Model

This directory contains the complete reassembled CAD model of the 
NorthForge3D Trident proof-of-concept printer.

This assembly links together:
- Frame subsystem
- Electronics bay
- Panels
- Gantry and motion system

Purpose:
- Validate clearances
- Confirm alignment between subsystems
- Check interference and fitment
- Visualize the printer as a whole prior to prototype construction

This assembly is the single source of truth for reviewing the current state 
of the printer design.

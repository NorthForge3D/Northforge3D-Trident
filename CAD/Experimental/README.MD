# Experimental CAD

This directory contains early-stage prototypes, alternate ideas, motion-system experiments, and designs that may or may not make it into the final Trident configuration.

These files are expected to change frequently and may be incomplete, untested, or incompatible with other components.

Use these only for reference — not for building.
